## S4A and joystick
Simple project demonstrating how to connect a joystick (sth. like http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Thumb_Joystick)
to the Arduino and use from within S4A.

Basically, all you need to do is connecting the joystick as described and watch the Analog1 and Analog2 values changing
in S4A.
