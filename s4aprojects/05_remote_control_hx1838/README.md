# Infrared Remote Control
This project demonstrates the usage of an infrared remote control (e.g. HX1838) with S4A and Arduino.

**Important Note:** This project requires the custom firmware as found in here to be uploaded to the Arduino. 
This firmware reads the corresponding key values being pressed on the remote control and sends returns 
the key codes via the Analog3 input in S4A.
